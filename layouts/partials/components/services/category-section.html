{{/* JavaScript is usually placed in baseof.html or a separate JS file,
     but for self-contained components in Hugo, sometimes it's included like this.
     If this script block is identical for all service-category-sections,
     consider moving the generic part to a single script file loaded once.
     For now, assuming it's scoped per section as previously implemented.
     The following script will be PART of the category-section.html partial.
     If you have a global script, you'll need to adapt the event listeners.
     This example assumes the script part needs to be in THIS partial,
     and will be repeated if you have multiple such sections.
     A better approach would be a single script that handles all sections.
     For simplicity here, I'll keep the existing structure of the JS being per-section,
     but it's not ideal if you have many such sections.
     Revisiting the previous script logic, the JS IS global and handles multiple sections.
     The update will be in that global JS.
     So, the JS below should replace the script block from your PREVIOUS iteration
     (likely at the bottom of your baseof.html or a global JS file).
     I will provide the FULL script block here.
